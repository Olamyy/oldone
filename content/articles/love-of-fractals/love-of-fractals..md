I came across fractals towards the middle of last year and I've simply been interested by them. 

This interest has mainly been backed by two reasons.

1. Fractals are [beautiful](https://giphy.com/search/fractals).
1. While staring at fractals, you get a sense of continuity. 

    A sense of going into a never ending loop.
    
    A sense of not having to worry about anything.

3. Fractals are everywhere. You just need to look around you.


My interest in fractals encouraged me to study them in an attempt to understand how they're created naturally, 
mathematically and ways of replicating them in Python.
This article provides an overview of fractals, mentioning it's importance in nature, 
art and mathematics and also look into python implementations. 
The rest of the article would follow this pattern.

#Fractals

### What is a fractal?
First used by [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot), fractals are objects, whether mathematical, created by nature or by man, that are 
irregular, rough, porous or fragmented and which possess these properties at any scale. 
That is to say they have the same shape, whether seen from close or from far.


A fractal in simpler terms is a never ending pattern that repeats itself at different scales. While their origin occurrence was
natural, fractals are now being created mathematically using theories in geometry and algebra and also using various computer software.

Fractals have gained so much light in recent years that they've become academically recognized branch of mathematics and art studies. There are now
various schools offering courses in Fractal Geometry, Fractal Algebra and Fractal Arts.


### Fractals in Nature and Biology
Although fractal geometry is closely connected with computer techniques, some people had 
worked on fractals long before the invention of computers. 
Those people were British cartographers, who encountered the problem in measuring the length of Britain coast. 
The coastline measured on a large scale map was approximately half the length of coastline measured on a detailed map.
The closer they looked, the more detailed and longer the coastline became. 
They did not realize that they had discovered one of the main properties of fractals.
