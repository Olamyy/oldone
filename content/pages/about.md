Hi,

I’m a third year undergraduate student at The Obafemi Awowlowo Univeristy Ile-Ife .
Despite my major in Mathematics, I have a lot of interest in Computer Science.
I’m passionate about applying my knowledge in various fields of computer science and machine learning to improving various areas especially healthcare.  I have and am working on better solutions for helping healthcare facilities, doctors and patients get and provide better health services.

>In my mind, machine learning and computer science really have the power to make the gradual shift to preventative instead of reactionary healthcare. 
-Adit Deshpande

If you’re working in the medical field, don’t hesitate to reach out if you think there’s an opportunity for collaboration. Would love to discuss.
