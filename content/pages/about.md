![Me]({filename}/images/about-me.jpg)


Hello,

I’m a third year undergraduate student at The Obafemi Awowlowo Univeristy Ile-Ife .


Despite my major in Mathematics, I have a lot of interest in Computer Science. My interest in computer science span from web,algorithm design, computational statistics to Machine Learning Research.

My primary research interests are :

1. Recommender Systems
1. Medical Diagnosis


I’m passionate about applying my knowledge in various fields of computer science and machine learning to improve and possibly innovate various areas especially product recommendation and healthcare diagnosis.  

If you’re working on anything interesting in any of my areas of interest, don’t hesitate to reach out to at <olamyy53@gmail.com> if you think there’s an opportunity for collaboration. Would love to discuss.
